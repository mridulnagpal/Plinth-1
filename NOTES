## 2012-02-24 template and theme changes

Added HTML5-Reset code http://html5reset.org
Removed robots.txt (we have "noindex,nofollow" in the template meta tags, do we need this?)
Added meta noindex,nofollow,noarchive tags for specific robots (googlebot etc.)
Removed extraneous meta tags useful only for indexing
Removed HTML5-Reset "_" directory.  Not sure why it's useful to add an ambiguous folder to the directory tree.
Made sure no Google-y code wasn't included (analytics, remote copy of JQuery, etc.)
Fixed symbolic link docs/style.css
New favicon and iOS "web clip" button
